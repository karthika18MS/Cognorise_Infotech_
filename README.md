Machine Learning Algorithm on Brest Cancer DatasetÂ¶
Introduction
Breast cancer classification refers to the process of using machine learning algorithms to predict whether a breast tissue mass is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on various features derived from medical imaging data, such as mammograms or biopsies. This classification is a critical aspect of medical diagnosis, aiding doctors in making informed decisions about patient treatment and care.

Machine learning models are trained using historical data, where the features representing characteristics of the breast mass (such as size, shape, and texture) are associated with their corresponding diagnostic outcomes (malignant or benign). These models learn patterns from the training data and can then predict the likelihood of new, unseen cases being cancerous or non-cancerous.

Accurate breast cancer classification can significantly improve early detection rates and patient outcomes. It reduces the need for unnecessary invasive procedures in cases of benign masses and ensures that malignant cases are identified promptly, leading to timely medical interventions and potentially life-saving treatments.

I'm going to use following Classification Models

Random Forest Classifier
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
To check which has the best Accuracy Scores
